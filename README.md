# GSM Road Trip from Nashville
This Holiday Road Trip app is designed for any user to plan excursions to our country's beautiful national parks. The starting point of trip will be Nashville, TN. The trip will include a national park destination and two other stops. The additional stops will include one Bizarrary and one Eatery.

The Great Smoky Mountains team created this app for someone like Jake, an active 33 year old father with two kids. However, anyone can find it useful and userfriendly. The user will see a single page app layout with designated spaces for the user to monitor and keep track of their selection processes. 

The user will make their trip selection starting with the state. Once the state is selected, a second, dependent, dropdown box will appear for them to select the park they want to visit. Once the user selects a park, a helpful five day forcast of the weather for that selected park's location will appear in the 'Trip Preview' space. Further, the user can select the eatery and attraction of their choice. Should the user want to find out more information about their selections, they can see the details shown at the bottom right of their screen after they click the 'details' button. Lastly, when the user completes their selection and clicks the 'Save Trip' button, a list of their 'Saved Trips' can be seen at the bottom of the page. 


The Great Smoky Mountains team at NSS-C55 include the following: Andrew Cheatham, Wesley Mitchel, Luke Slater, and Siprachanh Chanthaphaychith.
